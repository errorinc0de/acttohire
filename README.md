For decades in our country, engineering has piqued the interest of both students and their parents. Every year, an enormous number of job aspirants take engineering entrance examinations with the hopes of earning a large package. It was revealed that just around 7% of the country's total engineering graduates are employable, much to the astonishment of many. So, what's the deal with the country's engineers? Only 3% of graduates have the essential skills, knowledge, and expertise to land a job in the key areas of engineering, according to the findings. One of the most significant reasons for this is a lack of clarity on how to pursue their goals.
